					<h2>How I implemented Relaxr in 2 weeks and changed my life</h2>
					<img src="images/blog_photo1.jpg" alt="Look at them go!">
					<p>Fun story. Before Relaxr, I just did everything and created value by organising everything. and then Relaxr came along and just took it over. We didn't even ask it to. It simply just took over like some sort of Kafkaesque/Internet of Things (IoT) Horror. I have no control anymore. Help me. This coded blog post is the only way I can communicate with the outside world.</p>

					<h2>Relaxr has trapped me in a world without hope</h2>
					<img src="images/blog_photo2.jpg" alt="Relaxr is excuslively for boat automation">
					<p>by 2020, everything will be automated by Relaxr, including boats and fibre solutions to the boat. I don't know how this is possible, but with Relaxr, it is. <i>Everything.</i></p>

					<h1>About Relaxr</h1>
					<p>Are you relaxed yet? I sure am, with the help of a heady glass of gin and Relaxr, my job's never been better. Sure its increased the odds I'l get offshored, like that dude who outsourced his own job to China, proving that the future is offshored, meanwhile I'll eat my avocado on toast and dream of a future where I own a home in the CBD.
